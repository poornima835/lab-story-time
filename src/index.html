            Lily was waiting for her daughter Karen to return home. Their home was located at the edge of a
            small forest. Karen's father, Harold was very fond of that home as he had spent most of his childhood days
            in it. Though it was far from the town, he decided to live in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they moved into that home, Karen was only 2 years old. 
            When Kayva turned five, she had realized that she wanted more friends to play with.
            Once in a while they would go to their friend’s home in town. But for Karen, that was not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            One fine day, Karen told Lily that she had found someone to play with. 
            Karen described what her friend talked and looked like. Lily thought it could be someone from a nearby village. 
            But Lily was curious to know how such a young child travelled alone from a village.

            Lily asked Karen to bring her friend home. But she told her that her friend refused to see anyone. 
            Lily told Harold about this mysterious friend of Karen's. But he didn’t care much. 
            Lily decided to take things in her own hand and figure out who this friend was.
